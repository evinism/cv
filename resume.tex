\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed, designed, and implemented Discord's LLM abstraction layer, enabling traceability, observability, and vendor agnosticism to all LLM usage.
  % \item Enabled smooth pathways to transitioning from external OpenAI models to self-hosted models.
  \item Deployed, scaled, and cuto cost of serving of GenAI features to full production traffic.
  %\item Enabled sub-hourly batch jobs to bridge the gap between realtime and batch.
  %\item Supported ML Engineer across several orgs, enabling them to do the best work they can.
  \item Partnered directly with client teams to solve many hair-on-fire cross-disciplinary problems in ML.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Senior Software Engineer} 
\textit{Vidora, Inc.}
\hfill 
\textbf{Oct 2020 - May 2022}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advocated for, designed, and implemented a real-time multi-armed bandit optimization system, nearly doubling top-of-funnel sales pipeline. System operating in production at 100qps at peak.
  \item Architected a global ML serving engine with real-time predictions served under 100ms.
  \item Authored a language purpose-built for client-side feature computation. Ask me about MistQL!
  \item Shipped uplift modeling to Vidora's modeling platform. Completed under estimate.
  \item Built a CI/CD pipeline from the ground up, unearthing dozens of critical bugs.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer} 
\textit{Google, YouTube Mobile Web}
\hfill 
\textbf{Dec 2018 - Jul 2020}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Bootstrapped process for safe conversion of 40k LOC JS codebase to TypeScript, utilizing custom-built tooling. System in use for over a year with contributions from nearly a dozen developers across multiple teams. Enabled conversion with zero production issues.
  \item Planned and executed the cleanup and removal of ~100k LOC codebase of highly volatile, business-critical server side Python with no production issues.
  \item Rebuilt YouTube mWeb's settings page from the ground up. Released globally to ~200M users.
